<aside class="notes">

Before pitching the benefits of administering digitization production capacity via library-wide program, let's address the reason this proposal might make you leery:

**Why give up a sure thing?**

> After 10 years of provisioning digitization services by formula (tied to each school's HL allocation) it is clear that each school is provided more or less than they'd like or can use, year after year.

**Let's not romanticize the digitization allocations.**

> * When the Law School secured outside funding to digitize cases, or items to support legal history courses, the HL digitization was another just another mouth to feed. HLSL staff were already committed to other projects, so the items sent to Widener for digitization were difficult to prepare and track, and were in part selected not based on need, but instead on what could be sent with the least amount of preparation.

> * When Gutman was being renovated and special collections were stored off-site, GSE couldn't utilize its allocation. 

> * Staffing levels, renovations, and other priorities have episodically impeded digitization for every library.

> Of course the flip side is true as well: Every school has run out of IS production capacity during years when they had high-priority projects they were capable of sending to Imaging Services in greater quantities.

**Provisioning digitization production capacity by formula is inflexible, inefficient, and difficult to administer.**

<aside class="notes">
**What are we talking about?**

> Allocating digitization resources via a *Harvard Library Collections Digitization Program*

* Pitch and secure resources for local projects
* Develop multi-repository projects
    * Thematic (e.g., Anti-racist, CNA, Open Collections)
    * Format based (e.g., glass plate negatives, 35mm slides, maps, wax cylinders) 
    * Pool similar formats into larger, more efficient and specialized workflows
* Use the platform to raise funding that expands digitization resources for all.
* Access to more -- and more diverse -- digitization support services
    * (e.g., archival processing, preparing materials for digitization, cataloging, project management, conservation treatment, publicity)
</aside>

***

### Higher-visibility initiatives

<aside class="notes">

> A unified Library collections digitization program would develop and undertake large-scale initiatives that draw on collections from across the University.

* The program—a substantial, conspicuous new component of the Harvard Library -- would be responsible for developing and prioritizing digitization projects;
* Would serve as a hub for coordinating existing digitization services (e.g., Imaging Services, Preservation Services, Library Technology Services);
* Would foster internal and external partnerships; it could become a platform for championing the use of digitized resources as data to underpin emerging modes of computational analysis and inquiry;
* And it would actively promote its work to donors, funding agencies, scholars, and the public, through thoughtfully designed publicity campaigns.</aside>

***

### Flexible allocation of resources

<aside class="notes">By coordinating significant portions of Imaging Services’ and Preservation Services’ production capacity, the program would permit a more flexible, nimble allocation of resources. The program could efficiently stage and queue work, or shift resources responding to new demands and opportunities.
</aside>

***

### Reduced costs / increased efficiency

* A library-wide digitization program would provide an opportunity to pool digitization requests so that like formats (e.g., photographic prints, published materials, reel-to-reel magnetic tape) could be digitized via consolidated planning and administration, and through the application of uniform technical specifications and workflows.

***

### Reduced costs / increased efficiency

* A deep and diverse queue of projects and an extended planning horizon would allow us to better anticipate requisite staffing levels, inform equipment purchase decisions, and to identify new service-needs more quickly.

***

### Reduced costs / increased efficiency

    
* Additional flexibility comes from having more projects queued for digitization. Production units (Imaging Services, Preservation Services) can move narrowly focused projects into production quickly to take advantage of capacity that opens up when, inevitably, project schedules and priorities shift.
    
***

### Reduced costs / increased efficiency


* A broader view of digitization needs and priorities would improve the accuracy of annual budgeting and multiyear financial forecasting.
    
* Individual initiatives might be pooled into a larger project, some of which may be candidates for outsourced services including cataloging, conservation treatment, digitization, or transcription.

***

### Reduced costs / increased efficiency

    
* Generating a view of our collective digitization ambitions would better inform the ongoing development of our shared digital-library infrastructure (e.g., improved content delivery systems, tools for better managing digitized collections).

# Summing up

## More
- More coordination
- Leveraging economies of scale
- More flexible use of digitization service
- More access to digitization support services
- Higher visibility initiatives
- Higher impact resources
- Better target for external funding
- More efficient workflows

<aside class="notes">Large-scale projects often justify the purchase of specialized equipment, development of new workflows and specialized image processing.</aside>

***
### Less

* Administrative overhead

> <small>Small projects require largely the same planning and develop process as large projects. The more content we digitize per project, the lower the unit costs.</small>

***

## CURRENT STATE

### 8 uncoordinated imaging allocations

<small>

- Business School
- Divinity School
- Faculty of Arts and Sciences
- Graduate School of Design
- Graduate School of Education
- Kennedy School
- Law School
- Radcliffe Institute
